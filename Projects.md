We started promoting undergraduate research and community engagement through "A sociolinguistic study of the perception of stuttering" which resulted in a collaborative documentary media project in solidarity with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Assocition (NLSA). This project included people who stutter (PWS), members of provincial government, members of the public, educators, speech-language pathologists, academic researchers, university students, mental health professionals, disability advocates, and NLSA members. 

It was funded under Memorial’s Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program (USSIP) which provided an undergraduate student a supervised, public-research experience and further served to promote research among Memorial’s undergraduate student body.

As a community-engaged research project, we set two goals: 

1. to investigate public attitudes towards stuttering through the use of survey methodology and one-on-one interviews. Our findings have been used to target specific misconceptions and stereotypes that have negative impacts for people who stutter (PWS).

2. to communicate our research findings using educational, knowledge-mobilizing documentary media in order to encourage stuttering acceptance, help combat harmful stereotypes against PWS and help the NLSA provide informed support to PWS. We believe that our knowledge-based media can play a crucial role in empowering PWS.

Our results can be found in the [Silver Wave](https://www.swfilmfest.com/)-nominated "best student short-documentary, [Getting the Words Out](https://youtu.be/q5qlJvbfsCk) and our ongoing podcast series, [Some Stutter, Luh!](http://www.somestutterluh.ca).

Ongoing benefits to collaborators & stakeholders included of this project include:

- learning about stuttering research and how it could be used for NLSA advocacy
- discussing ways to leverage support from public and private agencies
- participating in research (e.g. to study / recognize deficits in the province’s programs and services for PWS)
- promoting cross-discipline research for both undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni
- volunteering for a worthy cause
- tackling social injustice
