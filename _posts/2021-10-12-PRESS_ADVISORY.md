"ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO STUTTER"

A community-engaged research group at Memorial University is inviting people to go online and fill out a research survey that will improve services for people in the province who stutter.

The group that developed the survey, The NLSA COLLABORATIVE, is seeking four types of respondents: people who stutter, their family members, educators and speech language pathologists.

"The goal is to collect data to help enhance and improve the lives of people who stutter in the province of NL," said Greg O'Grady, Chair, Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association.

Paul De Decker, Associate Professor, Department of Linguistics, Memorial University, who oversees the research project emphasized the importance of participation from throughout Newfoundland and Labrador.

"We need people from all across the province," De Decker said, "We need to not only highlight access to existing treatment services currently in place but to also identify gaps and barriers that exist. The survey will tell us where the province could develop specialized and subsidized support for people who stutter."

De Decker says the survey is available online.

It's estimated it will take 15-35 minutes to complete, depending on the amount of feedback one wishes to provide.

The NLSA COLLABORATIVE is a research group in solidarity with The Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and those with speech, language and voice impairments living in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. We are people who stutter (PWS), members of the provincial government, members of the public, educators, speech-language pathologists, academic researchers, university students, mental health professionals, disability advocates and NLSA members.

Established in 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association is a volunteer-driven, not-for-profit organization that provides advocacy and support to children, adolescents, and adults who stutter, along with their families and allies, to help them achieve their full personal and professional potentials by raising awareness, education, understanding, and acceptance of stuttering.
