The COMMCO-lab is entirely, 100%, online. We started promoting undergraduate research through a collaborative documentary media project in solidarity with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Assocition (NLSA), (Title: A sociolinguistic study of the perception of stuttering). This project was initiated in the summer of 2020 and is ongoing. Upon inception, it was funded under Memorial’s Undergraduate Student Summer Internship Program (USSIP) which provided an undergraduate student a supervised, scholarly-research experience and served to promote research among Memorial’s undergraduate student body.

The project established a partnership between the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and the Linguistics Department to better understand public perceptions of stuttering and persons who stutter (PWS) and to promote the mandates and goals of the NLSA to new communities across Newfoundland and Labrador.

As a community-engaged research project, we set two goals: 

1. to investigate public attitudes towards stuttering through the use of survey methodology and one-on-one interviews. Our findings have been used to target specific misconceptions and stereotypes that have negative impacts on PWS.

2. to communicate our research findings by producing educational, knowledge-mobilizing documentary media in order to encourage stuttering acceptance, help combat harmful stereotypes against PWS and help the NLSA provide informed support to PWS. We anticipate that our knowledge-based media can play a crucial role in empowering and instilling a sense of self-worth among PWS.

Our results can be found in the [Silver Wave](https://www.swfilmfest.com/)-nominated "best student short-documentary, [Getting the Words Out](https://youtu.be/q5qlJvbfsCk) and our ongoing podcast series, [Some Stutter, Luh!](somestutterluh.ca).
