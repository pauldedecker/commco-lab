The Communication Collaborative (COMMCO-Lab) is an interdisciplinary research and knowledge-exchange program, designed to foster a culture of research among undergraduate students at at Memorial University and within communities of Newfoundland and Labrador. We focus on asking questions about people, language and communication, espcially linguistic stigma, dis-communication and mis-communication. We specialize in using digital media production as tools for inquiry and engagement. This site is maintained by project director, Dr. Paul De Decker (pauldd@mun.ca).
