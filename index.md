The Communication Collaborative (COMMCO-Lab) is an online, experience-exchange group designed to foster a culture of solidarity research between students and citizens in their communities.

We specialize in digital media production as tools for engaging with and advocating for our neurodiverse partners and people who communicate differently.

Our lab is maintained by project director, <a href="mailto:pauldd@mun.ca">Paul De Decker</a>, a linguist at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador.

We acknowledge that the lands on which Memorial University’s campuses are situated are in the traditional territories of diverse Indigenous groups, and we acknowledge with respect the <a href=https://apihtawikosisan.com/2016/09/beyond-territorial-acknowledgments/>diverse histories and cultures</a> of the Beothuk, Mi’kmaq, Innu, and Inuit of this province.

[[Why do people communicate differently?]]
