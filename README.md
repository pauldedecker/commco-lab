This is the webpage for the Communication Collaborative, an interdisciplinary research and knowledge-exchange project, designed to foster a culture of community-based research with undergraduate students at at Memorial University of Newfoundland. We specialize in digital media production as tools for inquiry and engagement. This site is maintained by project director, Dr. Paul De Decker (pauldd@mun.ca).
